+ Added GUI options for Protos and BA to dialogs setting price/flu/comp mods.
+ Save the component, flu and price mods to pricemods.dat file instead of in
  the standard faction.dats. Save mechanism is slapdash and should probably be
  changed to be more efficient. Saving outside the usual string will make this
  easier to adjust at a later date, then incorporate into the normal saves.
- Removed support for old-style faction saves (monolithic houses.dat file).
+ Show costs in tooltip text when hovering over a factory in CHSPanel.
+ Do NOT reset faction timestamp after every conquer, as nothing relevant to

  .getPPForUnit(). Were non-static methods in CPlayer. Are now static methods
  in CUnit. Used in HS panel and by online help.
+ Moved isInHouseAttacks from House to SHouse and removed from binin and
  binout. Not used by any client-side code. 
+ Moved initialHouseRanking from House to SHouse and removed from binin and
  binout. Not used by any client-side code.
+ Moved motd from House to SHouse. Sent by server @ signin, not through the
  binin and binout data streams.

  and skip the load attempt if it is missing or empty.

v 0.1.44.x (Closed 10.17.06, no binary release)
+ RFE: Money/flu/component multipliers applied to purchases from factories not
  originally owned by the player's faction. Defaults are set to 1.0, which does
  not change cost. GUI to set is in ServerCongigDialog's Units2 tab. 
+ RFE: Only auto-produce units from factories originally owned by a faction.
+ RFE: Peg factory purchase cost to original faction instead of current owner.
+ New MM Jar with SB and Munitions patch and TW rules.
+ Deds attempt to sign on much more slowly after a connectionLost(). This does
  not stop "rogue" behaviour when two instances of a single ded are running at
  the same time, but makes it possible for owners to actually shot one down.
R Client 0.1.44.8
+ BUG: Deds buffering all commands b/c they never have a CMainFrame. I'm dumb.

R Client 0.1.44.6.
+ Changed place where saved mail request is issued, in the hope that it will
  fix the "PM Splash Crash" TT users are experiencing with Client 0.1.44.5.
R Client 0.1.44.5 / Server 0.1.44.6
+ Incoming data (as directed to MWClient.doParseDataInput) checked and stored
  if the main frame is null. Only data commands (USD, DSD) are allowed to
  proceed normally. Other commands are processed en block after CMainFrame is
  constructed. This stops NPE's, but makes the client open more slowly.
+ Moved main frame construction block in MWClient.java. Is now built after the
  chat connection opens and serverconfig.txt is fetched, to stop NPE's.
+ BUG: Infinite splash screen for any user who connects w/o a local copy of
  the campaignconfig.txt. Values from campaignconfig were being requested
  before a connection to the server was opened in order to fetch them, leading
  to a null MainFrame and unending splash.
+ BUG: Impossible for a new user to log into campaign. Server wasn't allowing
  /c getserverconfig to pass through and execute unless the issuing player was
  logged in by SignOn.java, making it impossible for an unenrolled user to get
  the campaignconfig.txt.
R Server 0.1.44.5
+ BUG: impossible to buy from worlds your faction controls.
R Client 0.1.44.4 / Server 0.1.44.4

+ RFE: Include duration of games in the resultsLog.
+ RFE: Show duration of games in /c modgames output.
+ RFE 1552224: Ability to not show players' names in Tick Reports. Two new
  options in ServerConfig's Faction tab. Uncheck to use faction names in place
  of player names in tick report, news feed entries, or both.
- Removed CUnit.getWeightclassName(). Dupe of Unit.getWeightClassDesc()

  of the PS| & CPlayer.setData(String s) pair.
- Removed Army.hasMoreInfantryThanElse() & replaced some enums w/ iterators.
+ BUG: Mezzo ignored when requesting a unit. Feature and associated classes
  removed instead of being fixed, as no Server Op used or wants the feature.
+ BUG: Status icons where not showing a place for Repair/Maintenace
  when in !dynamic mode.
+ BUG: visibilty for ops was using its own variable to calculate itself
+ BUG: OpponentListHelper caused an inf loop of people that were active

  opposite ends of the board like normal 2 player games.

  null to be listed instead of the number of players.
+ BUG: game visibility was going below min visibilty, due to dusk and night 
  fights
+ Streamlined RequestCommand. Support for old-style MMNET SOL requests wasn't
  needed anymore. NOTE: There appears to be a bug in RequestCommand which leads
  to mezzo/pricemods being ignored. More changes to the file are forthcoming.
+ Added to code to move Server Campaign Config data so that it is transfered
  via the chat port vs data port. First step removing data port.
+ BUG: Engine repair not working in bulk dialog.
- Removed cheatlog.X. Entries duped in modlog.X, making cheatlog superfluous.
+ RFE: Show use of StripUnits and DeleteAccount in mod channel.
+ Replaced usages of Boolean.valueOf(String s).booleanValue() with Java 1.5's
  Boolean.parseBoolean(String s). More compact code, and less autoboxing.

+ On-Line help for unit status icons
+ Replaced all instances of "Vacant" with hasVacantPilot checks.

  command may still fail on players with repairung units.
+ BUG: Opponent lists being built improperly after cancellation of games.
- Removed ShortValidator.genericAbleToDefend and OpponentListHelper.matches.
  Folded funtionality into OpponentListHelper.getOpponentsForAll(). This

  folders. Welfare.txt belongs in /standard.
+ Add warnings to errlog.0 when reading planets.xml that has TIMEZONE fields.
- Removed "ProductionTable" var from UnitFactory and subclasses. Unused MMNET
  remnant. After 2-3 widespread releases, should be able to re-use its token.
